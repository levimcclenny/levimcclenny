### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm currently a PhD Candidate in the Dept. of Electrical Engineering at Texas A&M in College Station. Additionally I'm working with the Army research Lab on projects of interest to the DoD. 

## Research Interests 
- Deep Learning - specifically Physics-Informed Machine Learning or Scientific Machine Learning. I'm fascinated by the intersection of Deep Learning and Physics. Recently I have been working on [algorithmic methodologies to improve training of PINNS](https://github.com/levimcclenny/SA-PINNs), as well as an open source software suite for [multi-GPU training of large problem domains for PINNS](docs.tensordiffeq.com)
- Materials Informatics - A lot of my research is centerd around materials applications. This is the main application domain of [TensorDiffEq](docs.tensordiffeq.com) as it stands, although it is applicable to any field of science. 

## Other Interests
I'm interested in a swath of topics that aren'r directly related to my research, but more computer science as a broad topic
- Distributed computing - I love working in distributed environments. The Army Research Lab has granted me an Nvidia DGX Station for my research, which is a platform I use heavily to experiment and build in distributed environments
- Compilers/IRs - I just find the intersection of hardware and software fascinating. I'm mostly a high-level programming language guy (python, R, etc) but I love learning more about the hardware interface, all the way down to assembly. 
- Computer Vision - early in my PhD I worked heavily in [computer vision with applications in materials informatics](https://github.com/levimcclenny/multimodal_transfer_learned_regression), and learned a lot about CV. I have been contributed to [d2l.ai](https://github.com/d2l-ai/d2l-en) with this knowledge of CV, Tensorflow, Distributed Computing, etc.
